        <p>In 1982, the Komsomolskaya Pravda paper sponsored a competition for young musicians called Zolotoy Kamerton (lit. 'Golden Tuning Fork'). DDT submitted three compositions - "Inoplanetyane" (Aliens), "Chyornoye solntse" (Black Sun), and "Ne strelyai!"
            (Don't Shoot!).[3] During the long-running competition, the group published their first album (on tape), Svinya na raduge (Pig on a Rainbow). The album contained elements of rock and roll, blues and country music. During this time, popular
            music in the former Soviet Union was split between sanctioned "official" performers who were admitted to the musicians' union, and underground artists. Such underground artists were often highly trained musicians who also had other jobs. A
            complex underground network evolved in the 1980s and "unofficial" music became widely distributed (although the compensation for the artists was very limited), by "magnitizdat", i.e., in a similar way to the underground channels that had existed
            for non-state sanctioned literature (samizdat). Such "underground" artists became widely known, and their unofficial albums were sometimes mentioned in the press. In the 1980s, DDT straddled the line between underground and sanctioned artists,
            but was close to the underground in their musical, lyrical, and performing styles.</p>
        <p>DDT's submission to Zolotoy Kamerton reached the final round of the competition and the group was invited to perform in concert at Moscow's Orlyonok complex, together with the other finalist, Rok-sentyabr (Rock-September) from Cherepovets. DDT
            and three members of Rock-September, Vyacheslav Kobrin, Yevgeny Belozyorov and Andrey Maslennikov, soon produced a collaborative album (on tape), Monolog v Saigone (Monologue in Saigon), later renamed to Kompromiss (Compromise). After recording
            the album, Sigachyov and Shevchuk returned to Ufa.</p>
